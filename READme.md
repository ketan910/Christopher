## Christopher 

**Christopher** is a research project exploring the role of machine intelligence in solving the global problem of **_illiteracy_**. Primarily this involves developing new machine intelligent tools and techniques to make children learn with 100% *human-free* and *non-verbal* methodologies. But it's also an exploration in building smarter interfaces that allow teachers and educators to extend their processes of teaching and delivering new techniques using these models. We use [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Megenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/) as our supporting libraries and release our models and tools in open source on this GitHub repository. If you would like to learn more about Christopher, check out our [blog](https://stemai.github.io), where we post technical details. You can also join our discussion group.

Special thanks to the Google AI team for their paper on Generative Networks which is the base of Christopher. Our gratitude also goes to IBM Watson team for their constant support and GitHub for supporting such small projects. You guys means alot. :tada:
