## What should I know before I get started?

### Christopher
We are tring to solve illiteracy and this is not an easy job. There is no certain syllabus to know about what a **_contributor_** should know. But we tried very hard to refine the role of developers. 

### Design Decisions
When we make a significant decision in how we maintain the project and what we can or can not support, we will document it in the [christopher/design-decision repo](). If you have a question around how we do things, check to see if it is documented there. If it is _not_ documented there, please open a new topic on [Discuss, the official stemAI message board]() and ask your questions.
